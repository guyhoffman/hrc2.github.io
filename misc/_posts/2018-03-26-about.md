# Design and Implementation

This page is heavily adapted, well... let's call it by its name, almost verbatim copied from [D. Allan Drummond]'s Jekyll code and setup. His site was in turn based on the by now classic [Trevor Bedford] group [site][1]. 

This site is not officially public yet, and more comments as to its internals and code will be hopefully by online soon. In the meantime, the site's [source code] is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate attribution and a link back [here](http://hrc2.io/about.html).

Yes, even this last attribution notice was copied from Drummond.
